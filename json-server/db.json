            "There are other ways to run JS code in a browser. So, if we talk about the usual use of JavaScript programs, they are loaded into the browser to ensure the operation of web pages. As a rule, the code is formatted as separate files with the .js extension, which are connected to web pages, but the program code can also be included directly in the page code. All this is done using the <script> tag. When the browser detects such code, it executes it. Details about the script tag can be found on the w3school.com website. In particular, let's look at an example demonstrating working with a web page using JavaScript, given on this resource. This example can also be run using this resource (look for the Try it Yourself button), but we will do it a little differently. Namely, we will create a new file in some text editor (for example, in VS Code or Notepad++), which we will call hello.html, and add the following code to it:"
